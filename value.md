# Models of Value

How can you write down all your values in life, when they change and grow to suit you and your situation? When writing them down seems to invalidate their "mystery", or seem disingenuous?

How do you balance the values you want to have with the ones you actually follow? How do you try to keep your personality in tact, try to know what you want to be, and then try to move towards that?

You often only ever have a model, and you may not know what you want, or what would even be good for you.

>Stay flexible. Go with the flow when the flow seems nice, and store up energy for the times when you have to fight.

If you can figure out how often you have those cycles of follow and fight, and how much you need to prepare for them, you may be able to make some efficiency gains.

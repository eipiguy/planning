# Planning

Planning is ultimately a task in resource management where your most valuable resource is often time/work-hours.

First, know what you have. Then know what you want, and what the acting agents, often families in organizations, around you have and want.

Break desires down into their component parts, based on resource needs if possible. What does it take to get that? There is a chain of events that leads up to and continues after every event. A desire does not exist in isolation.

Figure out the possible paths from where you are now to where you want to be, and take notes. You need a method by which to find the "best" route. This cannot be a plan. Plans expect certainty, and real goals change quite often. Instead what you need is an adaptable and robust collection of [strategies](https://youtu.be/iuYlGRnC7J8).

Reflect thoughtfully and often. Grow. Distill.

## Steps

Everything is about transitions. Going from one frame of mind to another. Creating is about starting loose. Let go of all that holds you back, and hone in on what you would really want if there were no strings attached. Then we slowly add the strings back in and adjust. This is one of my current strategies.

Start by brainstorming, and then slowly put those ideas into more and more organized forms, removing the chaff as you go.

The next thing to think about will be metrics. You don't know anything about where you're going if you don't know where you are.

But first thing's first:

2. Indented List
3. Diagram

### Start Small

When forming ideas, it's best to start by just pulling things out of the ether at first. Brainstorm. Do some free-writing and get a bag of words on a page. It's easy to critique yourself at this stage and slow down, but down. Let loose and wait until you have a huge dataset of options before starting to decide which ones you like best. Do not filter as you go: choose afterwards.

Slowly start to focus on your feelings *about* the stuff you're getting out of the brainstorm. Feel free to keep adding to it as you start to develop preferences, but start thinking about the ones that actually seem to reflect the issue at hand.

Spend less and less on getting more stuff out, and start moving towards keeping the ones you want. Once you're satisfied with the results, and are doing nothing but organizing, move on from the bag of words.

### Organizing

Once you're organizing, it's time to start thinking resources.

In this order, ask everyone involved:

1. What do you "need" and how much do you "need" it?  
  a. What needs are actually "wants", ie. what are you willing to give on?  
  b. What aversions and hard lines are there?
2. What do you have to offer towards fulfilling needs?
3. What do we have collectively?
4. What can we get away without based on those resources?
5. Based on the needs we desire to achieve, what resources will we use and how will we achieve them? What metrics will we use to track our progress?

I have yet to really put this practice into action, but I love the idea of a ranking system for needs, where:

- 0 means "this need can't or won't be satisfied", eg. I want to make a freshly cooked meal seven days a wekk
- 1 means "will go along with this need, even though I don't want to", eg. Python is the most ubiquitous language, therefore I will go along with it
- 2 means "actively want this need to be satisfied", eg. I want to work on a Linux, I want to work on a desktop (I'm on a windows desktop)
- 3 means "this need must be satisfied, no questions", eg. I *will* have coffee in the morning

This requires the needs to be atomic in nature. Break needs down as far as necessary to make interacting with your resources straightforward.

## Sequential Habits

Each person, and each thing, is often bound by the same problems as a single core processor: you can only do one thing at a time. You have strengths and weaknesses, and you must delegate and decide what to spend more or less time on. This is not a direct interaction, you must translate these things to the more practical questions of "for how long?", and "how often?" for each task. Or maybe more directly: "when to pause what you're doing" and "what to switch to", in an abstract level of hierarchies.

This is not an easy task, and brings to mind a server system of producer/consumers.

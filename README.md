This is all a personal model. It is in no way a model for life, work, a belief system, or even necessarily true to the real world in any sense other than its immediate practical uses to me. I will revise it as long as I am able and willing towards those goals, but they are too lofty to be considered as anything other than directional ideals.

# How to plan

Planning is ultimately a task in resource management where your most valuable resource is often time/work-hours.

First, know what you have. Then know what you want, and what the things around you want.

Break desires down into their component parts. What does it take to get that? Is that what you really want?
There is a chain of events that lead up to and continue after every event. A desire does not exist in isolation.

Figure out the possible paths from where you are now to where you want to be, and take notes.

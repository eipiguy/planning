All things change, and all things in this document and its template will evolve over time. Keep records when things go unexpectedly.

## Current Intent

What's the idea? What are you currently trying to do? What are you trying to get out of the whole thing?

## Inspiration

You'll be reinventing the wheel if you don't go to the market and see what other people have already done.

- A
- B

## Off Ramp

What is the bare minimum it takes to have a "usable" result? Without an off ramp you're investing in a new lifestyle.

## Goals

First words, then lists, then diagrams. Think big and prune. Tasks are better than ideas.

- [ ] Main thing to do
  - [ ] There are always parts to it
  - [ ] More than one thing makes a list
- [ ] Make a follow up task

> *Tasks* age like milk, not like wine. Only schedule what is necessary. Ideas go in an "IDEAS.md" file, not the road-map. Select tasks from the pool of ideas.

### Constraints?
